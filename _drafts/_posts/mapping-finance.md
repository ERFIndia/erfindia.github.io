Prasenjit Bose, Zico Dasgupta, Rohit Azad

The  Indian growth story of the 2000s’ cannot be over-simplistically  explained as a result of “market-oriented” reforms. Public sector bank  credit-financed investments, particularly in the infrastructure sector,  played a significant role in sustaining growth, most crucially after the  global economic crisis.
