## Has Donald Trump Already Changed US Trade?

C P Chandrasekhar and Jayati Ghosh

There is no doubt that President Trump is upending global trade. He  has unleashed a trade war with China as well as with some of the US’ s  purported allies, using grounds of “threats to national security” to  impose tariffs on many US imports. The likely retaliation will obviously  affect some US exports in turn. The trajectory of world trade suddenly  looks quite uncertain – and this will also depress investment across the  trading world.

So the Trump effect on world trade is clearly just beginning. But the  naked self-interest of Trump’s moves, the “America first” orientation  declared by the US President should not be interpreted only in the doom  saying tones of much of the mainstream media. The truth is that this  orientation is not new: US trade policy always put the US first – or at  the very least, privileged the interests of US capital vis-à-vis all  other players. The US strongly influenced the Uruguay Round of the GATT  that introduced many new elements into trade negotiations (such as  services, intellectual property provisions and trade-related investment  measures) to benefit US multinationals.

Subsequently, despite the promises made in the so-called “Doha  Round”, the US and other advanced countries simply ignored the genuine  demands and concerns about the unfair functioning of the WTO agreements.  In other bilateral and plurilateral negotiations, they have  aggressively pushed for even stronger rules for intellectual property  that enabled monopolies and rent-seeking by their own companies, and  then sought to protect them through Investor-State Dispute Settlement  mechanisms, with little concern for the impact on other economies. They  have denied developing countries the right to ensure their own food  security even as they have used the small print of various agreements to  continue to give as many subsidies as they like themselves.

The difference is that today President Trump, as the head of the  waning superpower, is no longer as interested in supporting the  neoliberal order that allowed the US to retain global supremacy for so  long, and is happy to declare it as being against US interests.  Of  course, he will still promote US capital as aggressively as was done  before, but the apparently “neutral” rules of the game that were pushed  by previous US Presidents are now seen as providing too many  opportunities to pretenders, and therefore are sought to be overturned.

This is obviously a challenge for all US trading partners, but this  also presents many developing countries with significant opportunities.  Periods of global capitalist instability are generally seen as dark  times, but through history they have also been periods when the  established international division of labour (which tends to get  cemented in more stable times) was changed, because they allowed newly  industrialising countries to access markets and have some freedom in  their own industrial policies.

But even before the breakout of a trade war, which seems more and  more possible, how much has the Trump administration already affected US  trade patterns? In the absence of clear policies over the past year,  even the bellicose statements and threats made by the US President could  be expected to have some impact. So let us examine the trade patterns  of the US over the period of the second Obama administration and the  first year of the Trump regime, to see if there was any significant  change.

Chart 1 describes the quarterly shares of the US in world merchandise  trade, the area in which Trump claims that the US has been “exploited”  by trading partners because of its large deficits. There is of course an  obvious logical fallacy here, of treating net exports as inherently  more advantageous even for the holder of the world’s reserve currency.  But in fact, as evident from Chart 1, US shares of both global exports  and imports (which increased from 2011 to the end of 2014, began  declining in the first quarter of 2015 in the middle of Obama’s second  tenure. This has continued into Trump’s first year – but over this later  period the US trade deficit widened after reducing for several years.

                              Chart 1.

It is well known that merchandise trade represents only a part of  total trade, and services trade has increased sharply in the period of  globalisation. Chart 2 shows that the US has had surpluses in services  trade, so that the net trade balance in both goods and services is  somewhat lower. Here too, the broadly cyclical pattern of the previous  four years continued into Trump’s first year. Even so, the increase in  the merchandise trade deficit was so large that the services surplus  could not compensate, and the net deficit has been increasing sharply  after Trump came to power. It is true that the US economy grew faster  last year, which would have affected imports as well. But the  interesting point to note is that the services trade surplus did not  increase as much as could be expected.

                                Chart 2.

The breakdown of the US services balance, shown in Chart 3, is  revealing. The US has a deficit in transport services, which tend to be  related to its volume of trade. Travel services have been volatile, but  the net export of such services (essentially through tourism) declined  in the past year. The big story is in other commercial services, which  includes the range of services in which US companies are globally  competitive: construction; insurance and pension services; charges for  the use of intellectual property; telecommunications, computer and  information services; other business services; and personal, cultural  and recreational services_._ The trade balance in this category  increased significantly from $164 bn in the last year of the Obama  administration, to $175 bn in the first year of President Trump. For  whatever reason, the rents of UN MNCs from various kinds of intellectual  property and market dominance in media and entertainment industries, as  well as the sector so beloved of the US President, construction – have  already shown even greater increases during his tenure so far.

What are the implications of all this for the US’s trading partners?  The obvious lessons are already well known: do not expect any  concessions from the US on any front and watch your own back. But there  are other less obvious lessons. Pious neoliberal multilateralism, as  expressed in the rules and operations of the WTO, created a system of  monstrous but legally entrenched inequalities. The implosion of that  system lays bare some of its hypocrisy. Perhaps smashing the myth of  benign intent will allow all countries to demand policy space to address  the real concerns of their own citizens.
