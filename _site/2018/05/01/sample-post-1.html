<p>C P Chandrasekhar</p>

<p>As ﬁscal year 2017–18 drew to a close, the Government of India  decided to bite the bullet and implement a proposal to “resolve” what  was being presented as one of the leading challenges then facing the  Indian economy: large non-performing assets (NPAs) on the books of the  banks, especially the public sector banks (PSBs).The Recapitalisation  plan, ﬁrst announced in October 2017, involved infusing ‘2.11 lakh crore  of new equity into the PSBs, of which ‘1,35,000 crore would be new  money from the government, ﬁnanced with recapitalisation bonds. Another  ‘18,139 crore was the balance due under the ‘70,000 crore Indradhanush  plan initiated in August 2015 and funded from the government’s budget.  The remaining ‘57,861 crore was to be mobilised by the banks from the  market. The plan was to clean up the books of the banks to a signiﬁcant  extent, enabling them to adhere to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI)  voluntary decision to get banks to meet Basel III-type capital adequacy  norms by 2019.</p>

<p>If corporate borrowers are let off the hook and losses of the banks  are re-capitalised with resources from the budget, then private losses  are clearly being socialised, since their burden is being transferred to  those paying direct and indirect taxes today or in the future. This has  been under way for some time now. Between 2000–01 and 2014–15,  budgetary allocations for re-capitalisation of banks totalled `81,200  crore. Much of this was provided for in recent years, with as much as  ‘58,600 crore (or 72% of the total) announced during just four  consecutive years ending 2013–14. However, the government seemed to have  lost the appetite for such re-capitalisation. Even when it was seen as  unavoidable, allocations from the budget for the purpose were short of  what was promised, and what was promised was short of what was required.  In 2014–15, while ‘11,200 crore was allocated for the purpose in the  budget, actual capital infusion into PSBs was just ‘6,990 crore. Then in  2015–16 there was a revival, despite the initial reduction of even the  budgetary allocation for the purpose to ‘7,940 crore. In the course of  the year, the government announced a four year Indradhanush plan, under  which the PSBs would be provided with new capital worth ‘70,000 crore,  with ‘25,000 crore being disbursed that ﬁ nancial year and the next, and  ‘10,000 crore in each of the two subsequent years. In its most recent  avatar, the recapitalisation exercise is the `2.11 lakh crore plan  announced in October 2017.</p>
