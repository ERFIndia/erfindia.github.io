ERF acts as the secretariat for IDEAs (International Development Economics Associates), an international network of development economists, with more than 4000 network members based in more than 120 countries across the world. IDEAs is engaged in research, teaching and dissemination of critical analyses of economic policy and development. Its members are motivated by the need to strengthen and develop alternatives to the current mainstream economic paradigm as formulated by the neoliberal orthodoxy.

IDEAs was established in September 2001, following a conference in Cape Town, South Africa, on ‘Rethinking Development Economics’ organised by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) with the support of Ford Foundation.
