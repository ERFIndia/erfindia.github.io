[**MacroScan**](http://www.macroscan.org/) seeks to provide an alternative to conservative and mainstream positions in economics. It undertakes and disseminates analyses, by professional economists, of the Indian and global economy. MacroScan also attempts to build capacities to undertake such analyses in order to strengthen those advocating an alternative economic paradigm.

Towards this end it has built a comprehensive database on the Indian economy. The database includes time series information dating from as early as the 1950s, on a host of variables in the areas of national accounts, money supply, public finance, prices, agricultural and industrial production, trade and the balance of payments.

[**MappingFinance**](http://www.macroscan.org/) is a joint initiative of International Development Economics Associates (IDEAs) and the Economic Research Foundation in collaboration with the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College and with support from the Ford Foundation under its Reforming Global Financial Governance initiative.

MappingFinance seeks to contribute to this project by mapping developments in financial sectors, particularly in Asia. It seeks to track and analyse broader global developments, contextualise their impact on emerging economies and trace attempts to regulate financial sectors and address the challenges faced therein.
