**MacroScan** seeks to provide an alternative to conservative and mainstream positions in economics. It undertakes and disseminates analyses, by professional economists, of the Indian and global economy. MacroScan also attempts to build capacities to undertake such analyses in order to strengthen those advocating an alternative economic paradigm.

Towards this end it has built a comprehensive database on the Indian economy. The database includes time series information dating from as early as the 1950s, on a host of variables in the areas of national accounts, money supply, public finance, prices, agricultural and industrial production, trade and the balance of payments.
